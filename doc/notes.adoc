SLIDE 1 : Introduction
----
* Hi, thanks for coming.
* It's an honor to be here. Thank you to the DevNation team.
* My name is Maxime Gr√©au.
* I'm French, and I will do my best so you can understand me.

* I'm here to speak about Java EE 7, WebSocket, Asciidoctor, and other technologies.
* I will show you how all those technologies can fit together in order to do a Real-time Collaborative Editor for AsciiDoc.

Asciidoctor is available for many programming languages, including:
* Ruby (MRI, JRuby, Rubinius)
* JavaScript (using Asciidoctor.js, transpiled from Ruby using Opal)
* Java, Groovy and any other language that runs on the JVM (using AsciidoctorJ, a Java API that leverages JRuby underneath)

SLIDE 08 :  AsciiDoc
----
* So AsciiDoc is 3 things
** concise: you can see what it looks like
** consistent: if you do 1 thing like add an image, you do a video,
you can just replace image by video and it's OK, otherwise the syntax is the same............................................................................
it's natural
............................................................................

** semantic: lot of opportunity to add information that will can't be displayed and can be used by tools
or in publishing

* So the beautiful thing about AsciiDoc is that it's clear
* You can see the hash of content

SLIDE 15 : AsciiDoc VS Asciidoctor
----
* AsciiDoc is a syntax for writing documentation, very similar to Markdown but much richer, similar because it's also a plain text format.
* Then we have Asciidoctor, the biggest piece, beacause it's the parser and all of the tools
* in the future we may have other implementation than Asciidoctor
* Asciidoc is a language like ruby language, java language

SLIDE 48 : Publier partout
----
* all others format: EPUB, PDF, they are very important but they are output format, display, presentation, format
* the content/source code is the most important thing
* with Asciidoc, you can get all those formats
